Global Games Jam 2024

Make your Nan a cup of tea!


Diversifiers:
Full of Beans (Sponsored by Transfuzer): Baked beans are a British delicacy that when used in this turn of phrase represent enthusiasm and energy. The final game should incorporate elements of this British saying, be it abstract, literal or something in-between. We are looking to be feeling “Full of Beans” after playing it!

Koselig: Incorporate the Norwegian cultural concept of koselig into your game, referring to the warm feeling of closeness and coziness one gets when they’re with someone they care deeply about. Koselig is a quality that can be ascribed to moments, items, situations and people. It encompasses comfort, generosity, coziness, contentment, intimacy, friendliness and softness.

Art of the Tank: Provide rewards for players that lose.

Based on a True Story: The game is based on a real-life experience of one of the developers
